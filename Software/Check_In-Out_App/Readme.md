This folder contains the source code (.aia file) and the pre-built installation package (.apk file) for the QR code reader app.

The QR code reader app is intended to be installed on a table that is used by visitors to check out of Maker Nexus
using the QR code on their visitor badge.  Visitors may keep their bage and use it to check into Maker Nexus
again at a later date, obviating the need to re-fill out the visitor form.
